All 4G wireless routers come with SIM cards that provide data until 31 July 2021. To continue using routers after this date, you must [reset them and replace their SIM cards](/devices/reset-your-wireless-router).

## What you get

Each router bundle contains:

- 4G wireless router
- battery (with approximately 25% charge)
- charging cable (micro-USB)
- quick start guides

You should make young people and families aware that:

- SIM cards will remain active until 31 July 2021
- routers will need to be reset by the trust, local authority or school which sent the device to them, before inserting another SIM card
- they should not attempt to reset their own router, otherwise it will stop working
- once the 20GB limit has been reached the device will no longer connect to the internet

Step-by-step instructions for each type of router are provided below. These PDFs can be downloaded and given by schools or local authorities to users to help them get online.

## Technical support

For technical support, children and families should contact the trust, local authority or school that sent them the router. They can help set up routers or raise an issue if there is a problem with the router or SIM card.  They should not press the reset button.

### For local authorities and trusts

You can check the status of each router and if needed, raise an issue via the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). Login details will have been provided when you placed your order, but if you’re unable to access, [contact us](/get-support).

### For schools and colleges

You can check the status of each router in the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/). If you need to raise an issue, you will need to ask your trust or local authority to do this on your behalf. [Contact us](/get-support) if you’re unsure who to contact.

## Staying safe online

4G wireless routers provided by DfE use a filtering system that blocks inappropriate content and limits searching to the ‘Safe Search’ supported by popular search engines. The router is also set up to comply with privacy and human rights legislation.

If users are unable to access content required for remote education they should get in touch with their school or local authority contact.

Parents and guardians of the young people making use of these devices should be aware of advice on supervising internet use by children. Support for parents and carers to keep children safe from online harm is available at [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19#communicating-with-parents-carers-and-pupils](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19#communicating-with-parents-carers-and-pupils).

If a child is worried or needs support, they can call Childline (0800 1111), download their ‘For Me’ app or visit the website: [https://www.childline.org.uk/](https://www.childline.org.uk/).
